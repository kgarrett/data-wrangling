--Lecture "Sorts, Filters, Joins," 2017-03-07

Often have to use Excel because it slips into everyday workflow in a lot of different contexts, ubiquitous and available, do not have to install a server
Excel vs. SQL
  - Excel opens a file; loading that file into RAM and memory
  - As you move around in the file, Excel has to account for all the data present
  - Sometimes computer too slow to handle, not able to open or lags
  - SQL does not have to load data into memory to work; load just what it needs at the moment into RAM
  - Excel are more than just the data, also formulas which are computed on the fly
Excel
  - Set up sheets to be as similar to tabular data
  - Use first row as a header row, like column names in SQL
  - Everything under first row are records where attributes/columns are linked across a row
Export data from phpmyadmin
  - Export at the bottom of the page after selecting a table
  - Format: CSV
  - Check Custom - display all possible options
  - Check Put column names in the first row
Sort
  - What data are we going to sort? (column, sheet, etc.)
  - Data -> Sort
  - Check My list has headers
  - Can sort on specific columns, similar to ORDER BY

SELECT *
FROM performances
ORDER BY performances.venue_id ASC, performances.start ASC

Filter
  - Similar to conditions in the WHERE clause
  - Data -> Filter
  - Triangles show up and allow us to put conditions on columns

SELECT *
FROM performances
WHERE performances.venue_id = 5

  - SELECT queries do not alter the table but makes a copy of the data
  - Excel always has order so when you come back next time, the table will remain filtered
  - When rows or columns are hidden, the remaining rows/columns are highlighted
  - When columns are filtered, the icon contains a filter rather than an upside down triangle

Calculations
  - Using calculations, we can perform aggregate functions: COUNT, SUM, AVG
  - Formula begins with =
  - When copying a formula, hold down Command over the small blue square and double click to copy all the way to the end of the data
  - Set constants by using a dollar sign ($)
  - Good idea to create a Summary worksheet with all your calculations/queries then the rest of the data remains unaltered

Joins
  - JOINS are hard to do in Excel
  - No primary or foreign key, how do we create a join statement?
  - Eliminate invalid rows after building a giant table with all the rows and columns

VLOOKUP
INDEX MATCH - much more flexible
Formula:
=INDEX(user_types.csv!$A$2:$A$7,MATCH(log_data.csv!$B2,user_types.csv!$B$2:$B$7,0))

  - MATCH returns a number and then INDEX uses that number to find the value

IS NA
  - If you get N/A, do an action back
  - The question we are asking, "Is it N/A?"

=IF(
   ISNA(
       INDEX(user_types.csv!$A$2:$A$7,MATCH(log_data.csv!$B2,user_types.csv!$B$2:$B$7,0))
   ),
   "user",
   INDEX(user_types.csv!$A$2:$A$7,MATCH(log_data.csv!$B2,user_types.csv!$B$2:$B$7,0))
)
